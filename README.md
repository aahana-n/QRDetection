QR and Barcode Detection using OpenCV
This project detects QR codes and barcodes in real-time using OpenCV and saves the extracted data into a text file. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient, using only basic computer vision libraries without relying on external QR code databases.

#Features
1. Real-time detection of QR codes and barcodes using a webcam.
2. Automatic extraction and decoding of data.
3. Prevents duplicate entries for the same code.
4. Saves scanned data into a plain text file (mydata.txt).
5. Displays a confirmation message: "Data Saved Successfully" upon first-time scan.

#Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pyzbar (for barcode decoding)

#How to run
1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the main script: 
4. Show a QR code or barcode to the webcam.
5. If it's a new scan, the data will be saved in mydata.txt and a success message will be displayed.
